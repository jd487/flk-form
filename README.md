# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It also made use of the ts template.

The design of this app was a mix of MUI and custom components. This choice was made to showcase integration skills with a UI library, and to increase development speed.
Instead of ejecting, I have made use of CRACO to enable the integration of styled components, and MUI.
